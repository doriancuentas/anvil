# Claude Code Configuration

## Hooks Configuration

Configure these hooks to use Anvil for code quality:

```yaml
hooks:
  tool_use_pre:
    # Suggest Anvil for quality tasks while allowing manual tools
    - pattern: "(lint|format|prettier|eslint|black|isort|ruff|mypy)"
      command: "echo 'ðŸ”§ Tip: ./anvil lint provides comprehensive containerized quality checks'"
```

## Code Quality Focus

Anvil handles **code quality only** - no git management:

**Quality Checks:**
- Run `./anvil check` or `./anvil lint` to validate code quality
- Review `.anvil/results.yml` for detailed findings
- Anvil auto-fixes formatting, you handle logic issues

**Directory Structure:**
- Each project directory maintains separate `.anvil/` configuration
- Containers are global (shared for efficiency)
- Works in any directory: `./anvil check ./src` or `./anvil lint ./components`

### Code Quality

This project uses **Anvil** for bulletproof code quality management through containerized tools.

**Development Workflow:**

1. **Code Changes**: Make your code modifications
2. **Quality Check**: Run `./anvil check` or `./anvil lint` for validation
3. **Review Results**: Check `.anvil/results.yml` for issues and suggestions
4. **Fix Issues**: Address quality problems found by Anvil
5. **Ready**: Code is clean and follows project standards

**Key Commands:**

- `./anvil check` - Complete quality workflow (linting, security, formatting)
- `./anvil setup` - Initialize containers and configuration
- `./anvil results` - Show last quality check results

**Code Quality Tools (via Anvil containers):**

- **Python**: ruff, black, isort, mypy, bandit, safety
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: eslint, prettier, npm audit
- **Security**: semgrep, detect-secrets, dependency scanning
- **Environment**: Automatic project structure detection

**Important Notes:**

- All tools run in containers - no local installation required
- Anvil auto-fixes formatting and provides structured issue reports
- Always review `results.yml` after running quality checks
- Follow branch â†’ lint â†’ commit workflow for best practices

**Code Style Guidelines:**
- **NEVER add comments to code** - Commands should be self-descriptive
- Examples: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh` is clear, no need for "# Make scripts executable"
- Focus on writing clear, readable code rather than explaining it with comments
- Only add comments for complex business logic or algorithms, never for basic commands
